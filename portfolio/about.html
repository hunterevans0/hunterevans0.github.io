    <h2>About</h2>
    
    <p>I grew up with technology. I have had access to a computer my entire life.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I began programming in Scratch around <b>9</b> years old.</li>
        <li>I got my first tablet at age <b>10</b>.</li>
        <li>I built a computer when I was <b>11</b>.</li>
        <li>By the time I was <b>13</b>, I had a smart phone.</li>
        <li>At age <b>14</b> I took an Intro to Computer Systems class in high school.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I lost interest of all things computer related after my freshman year of high school. Between ages <b>14 and 20</b>, I studied a broad range of topics,
        <br> specifically agriculture, psychology, sociology, and philosophy. I only briefly studied each of these topics.
        <br> The next time I seriously looked at programming was at age <b>20</b>. 
    </p>
    <p>I began working on my <em>Associate Degree in Software Development</em> at this time. I found myself immersed in the logic and capabilities of programming. <br>The courses I took the first year focused on client-side technologies, while the second year focused on server-side languages.</p>
    <p>I will spend <strong>2 years</strong> developing my problem-solving skills at <i>The College of Western Idaho</i>.</p>
